I wanted to ask about Viserion and his coming back as unViserion since it happened in the show, something similar might happen in the books? We've all seen the Night King and the White Walkers riding undead horses, but somehow when he raised Viserion back from the dead, I thought it seemed too easy for him to do it that way.

The Opening (1997-2000) ----------------------------- I 'became a Christian' in 1997, in my first year at Edinburgh University, thanks to some very keen and lovely fellows from the Christian Union.

I have heard it claimed that due to certain criteria of historical evaluation, such as embarrassment and multiple attestations, that it is almost guaranteed that Jesus performed miracles. Others claim that it for more specific reasons, including the idea that since his opposition classified him as a sorcerer rather than as a charlatan, and since the account of the resurrection of Lazarus could easily be verified.
